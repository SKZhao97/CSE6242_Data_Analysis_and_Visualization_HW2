1. Ease to develop for developers

  Tableau: Easy to input and refine data and develop visualization based on graphical interface and embedded functions
  D3: Require good command of JavaScript and D3's toolset but has massive library
  Excel: Easy to operate data and develop basic visualization using pivot table


2. Ease to maintain the visualization for developers 

  Tableau: Need re-input then re-design if data changes and license required if platform changes
  D3: Pretty easy to maintain because JavaScript programs are flexible to the changes of data or platforms 
  Excel: Easy to replace data and maintain the visualization

3. Usability of visualization developed for end users

  Tableau: Excellent usability for end users because of the attractive visualization effects and interactive experience
  D3: Excellent usability because of the various visualization partterns and interactive events
  Excel: Fair usability for users with limited interactive events and ordinary design of visualization  

4. Scalability of visualization to “large” datasets 

  Tableau: Scalable to deal with large datasets because of excellent data connection ability
  D3: Good scalability to large datasets because the essence of D3 is code
  Excel: Not suitable to deal with large datasets because direct operations on cells, columns and rows

5. System requirements to run the visualization (e.g., browsers, OS, software licensing) for end users 

  Tableau: Needs license with high cost for any OS (e.g. windows, Mac) and cannot run on browsers
  D3: Run on any browsers or OS without licensing because of JavaScript's compatibility 
  Excel: Partially needs license for any OS and cannot run on browsers
